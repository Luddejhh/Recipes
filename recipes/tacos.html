  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>The beloved taco came to Sweden already in the 90s and hardly needs any further introduction. Today it is available in all imaginable variations, but the Friday favorite still consists of finely chopped vegetables, ground beef, corn and grated cheese in a taco shell. Topped of course with sour cream and a salsa!</p>
