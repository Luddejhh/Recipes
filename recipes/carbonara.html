 <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Cook the spaghetti about 3 minutes shorter than the instructions on the package say.
    Cut the pancetta into small pieces.
    Fry the pancetta in a wok or a frying pan with high sides without fat until it becomes crispy. Lift up and set aside. Leave the fat in the pan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Put the heat back on the pan with the frying fat, pour in about 3 dl of the pasta water and let it boil.
    Drain the spaghetti and add to the pan with the pancetta. Just like when you cook risotto in a broth, the pasta should be cooked in the frying fat. Let it boil for about 2-3 minutes and stir all the time, this causes the starch from the pasta to be secreted and it becomes a creamy sauce.
